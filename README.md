In this research, I replicated the work of Bousefsaf a framework for estimating Blood Pressure (BP) from publicly available Imaging Photoplethysmographic signals (iPPG) data. The remote measurement of physiological signals from video has gained attention in recent years, but estimating cardiovascular parameters such as oxygen saturation and Blood Pressure (BP) is still a challenging task, often limited by data availability and
controlled scenarios. Bousefsaf metho d involves a two-stage pro cessing chain, which converts iPPG to Contact Photoplethysmographic signals (cPPG) signals using a video
dataset, and estimate BP from the converted cPPG signals. A deep U-shap ed neural network is trained to recover the BP waveform from the iPPG signal by predicting the representation of a BP signal from the CWT of an iPPG signal. The inverse CWT transform is then used to obtain the BP time series. We evaluated the prop osed framework on a sample of 57 participants and found to exhibit close agreement with
ground truth BP values and met international standards for estimation of mean and diastolic BP. This is a unique approach to estimate continuous blo o d pressure waveform from facial video analysis prop osed by Bousefsaf.
